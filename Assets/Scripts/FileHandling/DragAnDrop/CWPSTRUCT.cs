 * This is a collection of Win API helpers. Mainly dealing with window message hooks
 * and file drag&drop support for Windows standalone Unity applications.
 * 
 * 2019.11.28 - Changed the "UnityDragAndDropHook" class to a static class. This
 *   has been done for IL2CPP support. IL2CPP can not marshall instance method
 *   callbacks passed to native code. So the callbacks must be static methods.
 *   Therefore all fields involved also need to be static.
